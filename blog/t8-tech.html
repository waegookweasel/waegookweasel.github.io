    As I’m beginning to consider what kinds of apps to create, security is one of my top concerns. Exploring security is one of the reasons I became interested in becoming a developer. Humans are putting a lot of faith in machines and systems to store sensitive information without really understanding how the machines and systems work.

    Within web security, there is a vast number of ways that security can be compromised. Below are some common vulnerabilities:
      <ol>
        <li>Injection
        <li>Broken Authentication
        <li>Cross-site Scripting
        <li>Insecure Direct Object References
        <li>Security Misconfiguration
      </ol>
    </p>

    Although a couple of years old, OWASP has a comprehensive <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top10#OWASP_Top_10_for_2013">pdf download</a> listing the top vulnerabilities.

    If you have an https site, QUALYS SSL LABS has a tool that can check your certificate and provide feedback about your site’s security.

    Dev Bootcamp’s site scored pretty well!

    In addition to a letter grade, the site provides a detailed report!

    The site recommends that a stronger signature is used when upgrading to a new certificate, although it's not critical.
