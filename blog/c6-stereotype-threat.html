    <p>This week we were asked to research styerotype threat. I watched the video below to learn more.

    I realized after watching the the video that I'd read about the concept in a Malcom Gladwell book. He noted that after Obama's election, young black men began to perform better on tests. Stereotype threat is the possibility of confirming negative stereotypes about a person's race, gender, orientation, etc.
    </p>
    <p>Stereotype threat can impact the way a person views themselves and their own performance. As shown in the video, if women feel like they are underperforming because of their gender, they will actually perform poorly. Likewise, if women are told that they will perform just as well as their male counterparts, they do so. Society seems to have a negative stereotype for just about every non-white non-male. It's troubling that those negative images play directly into one's performance.

    <p>Moreso than a minority issue, I suspect that this is a human issue. Communicating inferiority to another (whether true or not) has the ability to impact that person's performance. Our words, actions, and beliefs are more powerful than we realize. To me, it seems key is to consciously appraoch each person without preconceptions. Because society ingrains stereotypes (often times without our concent) into our minds, it's important to be aware of our misconceptions and consciously work to dismiss them.
