    <p>First, in the class versus id debate, it’s important to realize that this is not winner take all! Your elements can be stylized with using classes and ids simultaneously! Here’s an example:
    </p>
    <img src="../imgs/html.png" alt="html">
    <img src="../imgs/css.png" alt="css">
    <img src="../imgs/boxedbugs.png" alt="css">
    <p>When you’re creating a stylesheet, ask yourself if you are likely to repeat a style elsewhere in your html or if you plan to use it only once. Classes are best for repeating styles. (Again, you can combine them!) IDs are best for single use.
    </p>
    <p>One beautiful feature of using an ID is that it is characterized as having “high specificity.” This means that because of how specific it is, it can override class styles in your stylesheet. This can be particularly helpful if your stylesheet is a hot mess of style classes.
