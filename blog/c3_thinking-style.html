    <p>Abstract Sequential thinkers work well alone, want to learn from experts and verified sources, get frustrated when directions are not clear, and have the tendency to shut down if they feel like they do not have enough time to complete a task.</p>
    <p>Before starting Dev Bootcamp, we were asked to research our learning and thinking styles. Self-assessments showed that I am a kinesthetic learner with an Abstract Sequential thinking style; though I didn’t seem to be solidly in any thinking category:
    <p>Thinking Style: Abstract Sequential (predominantly)</p>

    <p>Kinesthetic learners, known as “do-ers,” learn by doing. They often struggle if learning entails a lot of reading or listening. Kinesthetic learners often need to move or stay stimulate and may easily become distracted.</p>
    <p>It was helpful to explore these styles prior to beginning Dev Bootcamp. Although there is an inherent risk in putting others or myself into boxes, I did find some benefit. Discovering that there are a variety of learning styles validated my desire to learn in my own way. Understanding that my brain may need movement or music while learning made me feel that it was ok to get up and move around while working through problems.</p>
    <p>I noticed characteristics of my thinking style appearing often while digging through the Dev Bootcamp curriculum. In particular, Abstract Sequentials become frustrated when directions are not clear. I noticed that I sometimes became so distracted by typos that continuing on with the challenge became… well, a challenge.</p>
    <p>The great news is that these moments became opportunities to flex a growth mindset. (More on Carol Dweck's theories of growth versus fixed mindsets <a href="http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_Dweck/">here</a>). Rather than getting hung up on challenges, I turned them into opportunities! I decided that addressing typos would be a great way to practice cloning repositories in git and creating pull requests.</p>
    <p>Understanding my thinking and learning strengths and weaknesses has helped me to sculpt a better dev!</p>
