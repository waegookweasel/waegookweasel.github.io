    I believe the adage that “there’s no such thing as a stupid question.” Learners should be able to feel free to ask questions, no matter how new they are to a concept.

    Some resources for writing good questions recommend avoiding yes or no questions. I think it’s important not to limit yourself as far what kinds of questions you can or can’t use. Besides, I think yes or no questions are helpful in seeking clarification.

    I think the best advice for asking good questions is to remind the asker to be patient, not interrupt, and to give the answerer plenty of time to think, respond, reflect, and add final thoughts. I’ve observed others and myself cutting people off in conversation, mostly just to keep the dialogue going. Perhaps we should not fear silence as much as we do.

    Finally, I’ve often found it useful to ask the same question in several different ways. This is particularly useful when you ask a question and you don’t like the first answer.
