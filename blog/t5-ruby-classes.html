<p>It's so hard to find a sandwich I can eat. Here's a class to help me select a sandwich.</p>

<p>First, I start by creating a class.</p>

<pre>class SandwichSelector
end</pre>

<p>Next, I need to populate my class with methods.</p>

<pre>class SandwichSelector

  def initialize
  end

  def menu
  end

  def vegetarianize
  end

  def lactose_free
  end

  def final_decision
  end

end</pre>

<p>There are so many sandwiches to choose from. Let's start by creating all of our sandwich possibilities in the first, intializing method. (Note that there are two extras! Nobody likes a plain sandwich.)</p>

<pre>  def initialize
    @meats = ["turkey","ham","bacon","chicken","roast beef"]
    @cheeses = ["swiss","cheddar","mozzarella","monterey jack"]
    @breads = ["rye bread","bagel","white bread","wheat bread"]
    @extras = ["mustard","lettuce","onion","mayo"]
    @meat = @meats.sample
    @cheese = @cheeses.sample
    @bread = @breads.sample
    @extra = @extras.sample(2).join" and "
    @sandwich = []
  end</pre>

<p>Here's a random sandwich special from the menu.</p>
<pre>  def menu
    puts "The special is a #{@meat} and #{@cheese} sandwich with #{@extra} on #{@bread}."
    @sandwich = [@meat, @cheese, @extra, @bread]
  end</pre>

<p>If you're a vegetarian, you can take off the meat by calling the #vegetarianize method. You can also make it lactose free with the #lactose_free method.</p>
<pre>def vegetarianize
    puts "I don't eat meat, so let's leave out the #{@meat}."
      @sandwich.delete_if {|ingredient| ingredient == @meat}
  end</pre>
<pre>def lactose_free
    puts "Dairy doesn't like me. Can we take off the #{@cheese}?"
    @sandwich.delete_if {|ingredient| ingredient == @cheese}
  end</pre>

<p>When you're ready to choose your sandwich, you can call the #final_decision method.</p>
<pre>def final_decision
    puts "OK, that'll be a sandwich with:"
    puts @sandwich
    puts
    if @sandwich.size < 3
      puts "Nevermind. I'll just get the hummus platter."
    else
      puts "I'll take that sandwich. It sounds great."
    end
  end</pre>

<p>Here's how I used my class to choose a sandwich... or rather, the hummus platter.</p>

<pre>my_sandwich = SandwichSelector.new
my_sandwich.menu
my_sandwich.vegetarianize
my_sandwich.lactose_free
my_sandwich.final_decision</pre>

<p>Here's the final output for my (vegetarian, lactose-free) sandwich:</p>

<pre>The special is a ham and monterey jack sandwich with onion and mayo on white bread.
I don't eat meat, so let's leave out the ham.
Dairy doesn't like me. Can we take off the monterey jack?
OK, that'll be a sandwich with:
onion and mayo
white bread

Nevermind. I'll just get the hummus platter.</pre>
