        A version control system is a repository (a stack of info or files) that tracks changes over time. Version control systems have been a thorn in my side since long before I knew they had a name. At work, when multiple users need access to the same document, we often have to take turns opening and modifying the file. Calling around to find out who has a document open and asking how long they’re going to need it is really no fun. Not all version control systems are so user-unfriendly. Many version control systems offer the ability for multiple users to edit content simultaneously. If you’re working in a group, it’s especially important to use a version control system that allows for efficient collaboration and sharing.

        Git is an open source version control system. As with many version control systems, Git allows a user to pull a copy of a file or project and make alterations. With Git, a user does not check out a version of a file or project; rather, the user clones it. A user can stores a copy of the file on their computer (called a local repository) and then is able to make changes even without network access. Git is distinguished from many other version control systems in that it is not server-dependent. If a central server goes down, several copies are likely stored in users’ local repositories. Unlike many other version control systems, Git offers the ability to push and pull versions between users.

        GitHub is a sort of social network site for users who need to share code. It’s a fast, efficient, and user-friendly way for developers to store and share code. GitHub facilitates the management of file versions in a way that requires less hardware, less disk space, and less confusion. To clarify, Git is an open source version control system software and GitHub is a company/site that utilizes Git to offer developers an interface for cooperative developing.
