    As humans, I think it’s probably impossible to pass through life without encountering conflicts. I don’t think that they have to be something to stress over or anxiously anticipate. Every bump is an opportunity to grow.

    I encountered many conflicts while living and working abroad. I hadn’t anticipated that when moving to Korea, I would encounter such a vastly different culture. I considered myself worldly and cultured, but I got schooled. In Korea, using the wrong hand to receive something can be offensive. Not standing when a superior enters the room can be offensive. You even have to be careful about what color pen you’re using to write someone’s name!

    Unavoidably, the cultural differences between my coworkers and I were apparent in the workplace. At first, I became very upset and almost furious, feeling like I had occasionally been intentionally disrespected. What I came to learn over time was that I had been assigning harmful intentions to others’ actions with no discussion.

    I came to understand that I had been offended by words and actions that were culturally acceptable in Korea. My experiences taught me to consider that just as one can reach over an international cultural divide, it is possible to reach over person-to-person cultural divides. We all have different backgrounds, different family cultures, different life experiences, etc. It’s important to consider that someone might be acting within THEIR norm and may not be intentionally offending you.

    I’ve found that passive aggression is toxic. Talking something out, while intimidating, is always going to return better results than brooding on hurt feelings. It’s important to be aware of how you’re feeling and how your body and mind are reacting to those feelings (with and WITHOUT your permission!).

    When I think about the Dev Bootcamp immersive, I suspect that we’re probably going to run into a few conflicts. (And not just the merge ones!) As long as we can keep these things in mind, I know we’ll be able to resolve our conflicts.
