    <p>As a new programmer with only ruby experience, it's difficult to make a case for why object oriented programming is superior to procedural languages. The book <a href="http://www.poodr.com/">Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby</a> has been helpful in developing my understanding of the advantages of object-oriented programming (OOP).
    </p>

    <p>It seems that OOP was developed to better manage communication between objects. Because of this communications management, changing or adjusting a piece of code is far less likely to destroy the project. Change is inevitable and even the best made applications will likely need to be adjusted or changed.
    </p>

    <p>Procedural languages seem to be a less desirable alternative to object-oriented languages. Procedural languages wrap data into variables and pass them to behaviors. From what I gather, this complicates accessibility and obfuscates what’s happening to and with the data.
    </p>

    <p>Object-oriented languages do not guarantee ease of change. It’s important to use object-oriented design principles and to consider the flexibility to make future changes while programming.
