    <p>Pair programming is a big part of Dev Bootcamp. Wrapped in pair programming is the request that we conclude our pairing sessions with anonymous feedback. Students have been prompted to give actionable, specific, and kind (ASK) feedback.  This idea meshes well with me. I’ve learned that pushing feelings down and avoiding communication often turn small problems into bigger ones. It’s best to communicate with your partner (programmer or otherwise) about what’s working and not working.</p>

    <p>I admit that the prospect of giving and receiving feedback seemed intimidating at first. There is a significant amount of vulnerability in opening yourself up, even to constructive criticism. Likewise, providing sensitive and meaningful feedback can be a daunting task too.</p>

    <p>I came into the program feeling a lot of fear that feedback would ratchet back my confidence and put yet another stumbling block in my path. To my surprise, the feedback I received was specific, actionable, and (most importantly) KIND.  I was surprised that the feedback I received actually boosted my confidence in my programming skills.</p>

    <p>Pairing has been a great part of this program for me. I have found that I learn quickly when I am working through a problem with a partner. Because I entered Dev Bootcamp with almost no coding experience, pairing means constantly admitting ignorance. This has been bittersweet for me. I have had to grow accustomed to feeling humble in order to learn quickly.Giving and receiving feedback has made the pairing environment much safer for me. After reading feedback, I realized that my negative self talk was wrong and that I able to contribute to my pairing challenges even though I'm new to the game.</p>

    <p>Adhering to ASK has made it easier for me to incorporate feedback, grow, and continue thriving in this rigorous program. I’m looking forward to pairing and learning more in the coming weeks.</p>
