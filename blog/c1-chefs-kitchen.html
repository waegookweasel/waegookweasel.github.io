        I am thrilled to be part of the first Columbus, Ohio cohort. Today available members of our cohort got coffee together and made introductions. I was inspired by a fellow bootcamper, Chris, who reminded us that each city has a unique culture and that we will be the first in our city. Chris said, “Let’s make it ours.” I had no idea what he was talking about because I had walked into Dev Bootcamp with a table mentality. I paid for my entrance and I was expecting to see a menu. Chris and the Fireside Chat with Shereef turned that around for me. At coffee this morning, we started setting up accounts with Slack and Trello. We stepped outside of the Curriculum instructions and did our own thing. GASP! I had a moment when I thought, “Are we allowed to do this?” Of course we are! Why wouldn’t we be allowed to take the steering wheel on our own learning?

        I think it may take time for me to head into “the kitchen.” I think I tend to sit back until I feel comfortable with something. Just knowing that I’m welcome in the kitchen warms me up to the idea. I’m sure I’ll be banging around pots in no time.

        My expectations of Dev Bootcamp have undoubtedly evolved as I went from knowing that it’s a cool thing that happens in Chicago and other cities, to knowing that I’d have the chance to participate, and finally to being a part of it. I expected much more cut-throat competitiveness. Today, when our cohort became aware that one of our fellow bootcampers was struggling through Prep, many in the cohort jumped in to catch her up. That’s not a culture that I’ve experienced in many other learning environments. This is going to be a different learning experience. Here we go!
